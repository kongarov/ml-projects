# ml-projects

These are 2 of my ml practicals for uni.

In the first file, I've implemented linear regression using the least squares method adn then exeprimented with it.
In the second, I have implemented a Na√Øve Bayes Classifier directly in python and then I have compared it with 
Logistic Regression on two different datasets.
